## Usage

> Some usage instructions
  Open the website on your laptop. For now, click on a deck to be shown that cohort's pictures. Click "Ready" when you think of a name for that person. If you know that person's name, say "Got It"; if not, click "Not Yet." The app will show you a card more often if you don't know that person and less once you already know them.
