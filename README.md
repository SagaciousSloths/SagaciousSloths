## Usage

> Some usage instructions
=== Google Form modifications ===
HR staff can modify the sample Google Form:
* Important: do not modify the date field, used to identify a specific student
* Modifying titles is OK
* If you add questions, add them at the end and keep the same spreadsheet if possible


=== Google spreadsheet use by HR Staff ===
The first X columns are automatically filled by Google Forms when prospective students fill out the Welcome Students form.


  Open the website on your laptop. For now, click on a deck to be shown that cohort's pictures. Click "Ready" when you think of a name for that person. If you know that person's name, say "Got It"; if not, click "Not Yet." The app will show you a card more often if you don't know that person and less once you already know them.
