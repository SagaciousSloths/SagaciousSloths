Demo:

1. Before joining a cohort, students put pictures of themselves on imgur and enter their names and image URLs into a Google form 

Benefits: simplifies work of HR staff:
* Don't have to enter student names themselves 
* Can modify cohorts simply in one place


2. Google puts all entries into a Google Sheet (automatically)
   Each line is a card that can be part of a quiz
   Decks are described in column E
   HR staff enters additional information on the sheet (like cohort name)
   One person can be shown in multiple cards: for example different images or decks

Benefits:
* Automatic connection with Google form
* Information easy for HR staff to update if people change cohorts for example

3. After users register with the site, they see a dashboard with all the decks and the number of cards they should work on in each deck
